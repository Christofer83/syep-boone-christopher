            Hello! my name is Christofer Castelan, I am a highschool student who is going to be a junior this year, my ability to be able to be focused, concentrated, and organized is what will make me successful throughout the rest of my years in school, in addition being focused, concentrated, and organized will also help with future goals plus any careers that need those abilities. I find myself to be a kind person but only to those who give that same kindness back, moreover I like to assist people who need help with anything or need any assistance with things like school work or just things that I am able to help with. Im not sure what career I want to have for myself in the future but with my traits working as a butler or as a personal driver would be best fitting for me and it will also probably be soemthing that I will find injoying. Doing coding has help with building my focus and my laptop skills, and because of this a new career path has opened up for me and that is becoming a producer, it probably wont be a career that I will strive for, but will be something that I will do for my free time and do for fun.
